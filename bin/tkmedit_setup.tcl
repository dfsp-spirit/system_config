# tkmedit_setup.tcl -- Tim's startup config file for manual brain edits in tkmedit.
# This performs brush setup, so you do not have to do it for each image. To use this script, append '-tcl ~/path/to/tkmedit_setup.tcl' to your tkmedit command line.
# See https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/TkMeditGuide/TkMeditReference/TkMeditScripting for more commands.
